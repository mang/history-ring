=== history-ring.el ===
this adds history to a prompt in emacs

until you exit/submit the prompt, history-ring also remembers any
edits you do to the lines, much like bash/zsh. it does not store
identical lines straight after each other.

=== usage ===
first, put (require 'history-ring) and (history-ring-init) in your
code. then make a function something like:

(defun history-prev ()
  (interactive)
  (history-ring-access 1 STARTPOINT ENDPOINT))

where START- and ENDPOINT is the position in the buffer where the
prompt is. then add to the function that sends the command, message,
or wathever your prompt does, the following:

(history-ring-add MSG)

where MSG is the text to be inserted into the history-ring
